# emote-prediction

Removes ping tax from emotes with a configurable delay for sit/stand to emulate any ping teabag if you use an insert macro

# Commands
Note, if using the commands in the toolbox channel or `/8`, ignore the `!` prefix

Command | Argument(s) | Example | Description
---|---|---|---
**!emote** | NONE | !emote| Returns commands and their values
**!emote** | idle | !emote idle| Blocks or allows idle emotes (blocked by default)
**!emote** | delay # | !emote delay 30| Sets the delay in ms for sit/stand to emulate teabag at different ping properly (30 by default)

note, if you do not care about teabagging, you can set delay to 0 to have zero ping tax on sitting or standing
